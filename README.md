# little_arrow
Hi!

This is my little Unity project, an easy-to-play game.
So what is the point? The point is simply shoot your enemies with the "Little Arrow"

If you wanna play it click [here](https://simmer.io/@HorvatKZ/little-arrow)
Move with AWSD or with arrows. Aim and shoot with mouse.

PS.: Have fun!
